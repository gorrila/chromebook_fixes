This script is to help apply a large amount of hot fixes for elementary OS Luna 12.04 on the HP Chromebook 14. This script should work for many other Chromebooks, but I've only tested it on my HP 14. 

# Usage: #
1. Install elementary OS Luna using Chrubuntu to partition the drive and then a live USB containing elementary OS Luna

2. Once installed, download the script and run the command from terminal: "sudo python ~/Downloads/elementary12.py"

3. Be sure to carefully type your username given during installation as this will be relied upon in the script

4. Follow along with the script reading each prompt carefully

5. If the script fails or you accidentally stop it, I don't have any good remedies besides looking at one of my manual guides. DON'T RUN IT A 2ND TIME NO MATTER WHAT

# After the script has finished and your system has rebooted you can optionally do the following: #

1. Assign a hotkey to Guake if you installed it using Guake Preferences as the default one won't work on Chromebooks

2. Set your themes and wingpanel settings in Elementary Tweaks from in the System Settings if you chose to install them

3. Delete your wired connection from Network Manager to avoid it trying to connect to it all the time

4. Enjoy elementary OS Luna
